# PDF Broker Statements to Ghostfolio

This repository automates the extraction of transaction data from PDF broker statements and imports them directly into [Ghostfolio](https://ghostfol.io/).
Currently, a parser for **Sunrise Securities** is implemented, and additional parsers (e.g., for **Flatex Austria**) will be added in the future.

## üöÄ Planned Features
- Support for multiple brokers (e.g., **Flatex Austria**).
- Automatic PDF folder monitoring: The script will **watch a directory** and process new files as they appear.
- Fully automated import into **Ghostfolio**.
