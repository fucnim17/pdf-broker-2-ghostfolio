# PDF Broker Statements to Ghostfolio

This repository automates the extraction of transaction data from PDF broker statements and imports them directly into [Ghostfolio](https://ghostfol.io/).
Currently, a parser for [Sunrise](https://www.sunrise.app/) is implemented, and additional parsers (e.g., for **Flatex Austria**) will be added in the future.

## üöÄ Planned Features
- Support for multiple brokers (e.g., **Flatex Austria**).
- Automatic PDF folder monitoring: The script will **watch a directory** and process new files as they appear.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fucnim17/pdf-broker-2-ghostfolio.git
cd pdf-broker-2-ghostfolio
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîë Getting a Ghostfolio Access Token
To import transactions, you need an API key from Ghostfolio:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/api/v1/auth/anonymous \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "accessToken": "<INSERT_SECURITY_TOKEN_OF_ACCOUNT>" }'
```

You will get your access token as a response like this:
`"accessToken": "eyJh..." `
